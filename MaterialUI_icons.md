# @material-ui/icons

This package provides the Google Material icons packaged as a set of React components.
Installation

Install the package in your project directory with:

` // with npm `
`npm install @material-ui/icons `
 
`// with yarn`
`yarn add @material-ui/icons`

These components use the Material-UI SvgIcon component to render the SVG path for each icon, and so a have a peer-dependency on the next release of Material-UI.

If you are not already using Material-UI in your project, you can add it with:

`// with npm`
`npm install @material-ui/core`
 
`// with yarn`
`yarn add @material-ui/core`
